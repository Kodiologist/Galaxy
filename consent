<h1>Research consent form</h1>

<p>Dear Subject,

<p>You are being asked to volunteer in a research study, Structure of Sexual Orientation. The purpose of the study is to learn about sexual feelings, sexual behavior, and some other kinds of behavior (such as drug use) and how these relate to each other.

<p>If you agree to participate, your part will be complete the following questionnaire. It should take no more than 30 minutes of your time.

<p>The only foreseeable risk to you for participating in this study is that many of the questions we ask you may be sensitive or embarrassing. There are no foreseeable benefits to you for participating in this study.

<p>If you are participating in this study through Amazon Mechanical Turk, there is a reward of money ($2) assigned to the Human Intelligence Task (HIT) you have accepted. You will receive this reward after completing the HIT provided that, in our opinion, you answered our questions thoughtfully, honestly, and manually (that is to say, without having a computer program complete the task for you), and you did not attempt the study more than once.

<p>The following procedures will be followed in an effort to keep your personal information confidential: your name will not be collected or used, nor will your IP address or Worker ID. We will use an internally generated subject number instead. To ensure that this research activity is being conducted properly, Stony Brook University's Committee on Research Involving Human Subjects and/or applicable officials of SBU and OHRP (Office for Human Research Protections) have the right to review study records, but confidentiality will be maintained as allowed by law.

<p>Your confidentiality will be kept to the degree permitted by the technology being used. No guarantees can be made regarding the interception of data sent via the Internet by any third parties. Data may exist on backups or server logs beyond the timeframe of this research project.

<p>There are no costs to you for participating in this study.

<p>Your participation is completely voluntary. You do not have to participate if you donâ€™t want to.

<p>If you have any questions, concerns, or complaints about the study, you may contact me at 631-632-7634 or <code>nicholas.eaton@stonybrook.edu</code>.

<p>If you have any questions about your rights as a research subject, or if you would like to obtain information or offer input, you may contact Ms. Judy Matuk, Committee on Research Involving Human Subjects, 631-632-9036, or by email <code>judy.matuk@stonybrook.edu</code>.

<p>If you complete the survey, it means that you have read (or have had read to you) the information contained in this letter, and would like to be a volunteer in this research study.

<p>Thank you,
